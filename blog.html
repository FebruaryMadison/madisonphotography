                    <h1>Blog</h1>
                    <p>This is my blog page where I post my most recent photos, share mini nature adventures, and talk about critters I run into that deserve more appreciation. I'll also share useful and sustainable products that I've tested that people who want to be more environmentally conscious might like. Lastly, I do lots of research and this is where I'll post informational articles relating to preserving wildlife and spreading awareness through education.</p>

                                <p>Hey everyone! I'm Madison and this is going to be my first ever blog post on this website. I wanted to talk a little bit about my website and what kinds of things I'm planning to post. I'd been wanting to have somewhere to post all my wildlife macro photography (close-ups of bees, flowers, landscapes, etc.) for a while. I thought of posting it on one of my socials but it didn't really fit with my other content and I didn't want to have a bunch of separate Instagram or Facebook accounts, etc. When I began this web design class and we started making a website, this felt like the perfect place where I could finally post all my photography and even allow people to download screensavers. I use all my own photos for screensavers on my phone and computer and I've been wanting to share some of them with other people who would appreciate them, so this website worked out perfectly! As for the other content on my website, I've recently gotten into sustainability products, which goes along well with the overall theme of the website: building a greater appreciation for nature. You can expect to see recommended products as I try out different ones, as well as research articles on important topics relating to the environment and greener living. That's it for now, thanks so much for checking out my website!</p>

                                <p>Hey guys, today I wanted to talk about the current website I'm obsessed with:  Zero Waste Store! Not only do they provide their own products, but they collaborate with other sustainable businesses to provide you with tons of options for environmentally-friendly household items. The top 3 on my wishlist right now are</p>

                                <p>But what exactly is sustainable living and how does it help the environment? Let's look at some relevant definitions!</p>

                                    <dt>Sustainable Living</dt>
                                    <dd>According to <a href="https://online.maryville.edu/blog/what-is-sustainable-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Maryville University</strong></a>, <em>"Sustainable living is the practice of making conscious lifestyle choices that reduce a person's impact on the environment."</em></dd>
                                    <dt>BPA-free</dt>
                                    <dd><em>Does not contain BPA.</em> Mayo Clinic says that, <em>"BPA stands for bisphenol A, an industrial chemical that has been used to make certain plastics and resins since the 1950s."</em> Visit <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/bpa/faq-20058331" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Mayo Clinic</strong></a> to see a list of possible side effects of BPA.</dd>
                                    <dt>Carbon Footprint</dt>
                                    <dd>Defined by <a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Oxford Languages</strong></a> as <em>"a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person, group, etc."</em> Carbon is the main culprit used to measure climate change.</dd>

                                <p>Hopefully these definitions helped clarify some things that you'll likely see on Zero Waste Store's website. Let me know if you have any questions or want me to dive deeper into some of these topics in future posts.</p>
