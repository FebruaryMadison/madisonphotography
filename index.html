						<p>Hey everyone! I'm Madison and this is going to be my first ever blog post on this website. I wanted to talk a little bit about my website and what kinds of things I'm planning to post. I'd been wanting to have somewhere to post all my wildlife macro photography (close-ups of bees, flowers, landscapes, etc.) for a while. I thought of posting it on one of my socials but it didn't really fit with my other content and I didn't want to have a bunch of separate Instagram or Facebook accounts, etc. When I began this web design class and we started making a website, this felt like the perfect place where I could finally post all my photography and even allow people to download screensavers. I use all my own photos for screensavers on my phone and computer and I've been wanting to share some of them with other people who would appreciate them, so this website worked out perfectly! As for the other content on my website, I've recently gotten into sustainability products, which goes along well with the overall theme of the website: building a greater appreciation for nature. You can expect to see recommended products as I try out different ones, as well as research articles on important topics relating to the environment and greener living. That's it for now, thanks so much for checking out my website!</p>
